             <p>Brian Harold May was born on 19 July 1947 in nursing home at Hampton Hill, Middlesex, England, and the only child of Ruth Irving and Harold May.The young May received his education at the Hampton Grammar School.An exceptional student, after graduation in 1965, he enrolled in the astrophysics program at London Imperial College, where he obtained his bachelor's degree in science. An exceptional student, after graduation in 1965, he enrolled in the astrophysics program at London Imperial College, where he obtained his bachelor's degree in science. He continued his education journey to more advance level which is Ph.D and would finish it by 1974  however due to his music career was booming at that time he only manage to complete and received his doctorate in 2007.
              
             <p>While at London Imperial College, May formed a rock band called Smile, his passion for music soon trumping his interest in astrophysics. In 1971, May put off completing his Ph.D. to hit the road with his band, renaming the group Queen—a name that was to become legendary in the world of rock 'n' roll.In 1973, after signing with EMI Records, Queen released their self-titled debut album, which went gold. With its fresh and unique sound, the group won over fans in both the United Kingdom and the United States.While recording Queen's albums, May applied his knowledge of physics in the recording studio: Using what he knew about sound waves, he created echoes that amplified the stomping and clapping section of the song, creating the illusion that the sounds were coming from a huge crowd of people. With "We Will Rock You," on the band's 1977 album News of the World, May strove to create an anthem that inspired audience participation and unity. The song achieved its desired effect at concerts, as crowd members stomped, chanted and clapped along in synchronicity.</p>
